there are two kind of process which gets executed in operating system.
  1:-independent process:-(the process which doesn't effect the execution of other process)
  2:-Cooperative process:-(execution of one effects the execution of other process because the share the same resource at some point)

criticat section:-critical section is a segment of code that can be accessed only by one process at a time.

any solution to the critical section problem must satisfy following three requirements:-
      1 Mutual exclusion:-(if a process is executing the critical section then no other process is allowed to execute it)
      2 Progress:(If no process is critical section then no other process from outside can block it from enteing into Critical section)
      3 Bounded waiting:(the concept of bounded waiting ony satisfies that no processno peocess have to wait forevere for critical section
        means no process should go to starvation for that there is a limit(boundry) for the process out side the critical section to get
        chance to be into critical section)in short(the waiting time for the process outside the critical section should be limited)
