memory layout of C Program:-
            
            
     
     the typical memory layout of C program consist of following 4 section.
            1:- Text segment(code segment)
            2:- Data segment
            3:- Heap segment
            4:- stack segment
     
    
Text segment:-the text segment also known as code segment contains the executable binary file of the process this is the read only
              memmory persented at the bottom of of the process
        
Data segment:-the data segment is a portion of virtual address space of the programm that containe global and static variable.this is
              not a read only emory as it stores global variable which could be changed at ay time it have to overrrite thAT LOCATION
              the data segment have it two partition:
                                    initialize data segment:-this is usually called data segemnt and stores all the data initialized
                                                             by the programmer.
                                    unInitialized data segment:-this is usually called BSS(block started by symbol) . it stores all the
                                                              uninitialized global and static variable declared by the programmer.
                                                              
Stack segment:-the stack contains temporary data such as local variable, function parameatre, return address, pointer address etc
               the stack area tradition adjoint the heap area and growos in opposit direction when it meats the heap the memory was exhausted.
  
Heap segment :-Heap stores dinamicly allocated memory to process on runtime. the heap area managed by malloc,calloc and free.
               the heap area is shared by all the library and dinamicly loaded memory.
