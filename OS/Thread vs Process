Process:-an application consist of one or more processes.process in the simplest term is an executing program.

thread:- thread is a light weight process. so one or more thread run in the context of process. A thread can execute at any part 
         of the process including part currently beoig executed by other threads.
         
         the typical difference is, Thread in same process runs in shared memory space while process runs in saperate memory space.
         
    
  Advantage of Thread:-
                1)Responsiveness:- if process is devided into multiple thread if one thread completess its execution than it's output
                                    will imidiately be responded.
                2)Context switch faster:-process context switch is more overheaded for cpu with respect to thread.
                3)Resorce sharing:-
                4)Effective Utilization of multiprocess system:-
                5)Enhanced throughput of System:- If process is devided into multiple threads and each thread function is considered
                                                  as one job then number of job completed in per unit time will increased.
                6)Communication:- as threads share the same memory space unlike procecc so the communication between thread is easier.
                                  we dont have to follow communication macchanism in thread like in process communication technioque.
         
         
         
Type of thread:-1)user level thred
                2)kernal level thread
