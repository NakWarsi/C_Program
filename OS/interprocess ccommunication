Inter process communication:- the inter process communication is a machanism which allows processes to communicate each other and 
                              syncronize their action.
                             
   the processes can communicate with each other using these two ways-
          1 shared memory
          2 message passing 
          
  shared memory:-communication between processes using shared memory requires to share some variable and this is completely dependent
                 on programmer that how he implements it .
                 suppose process1 and process2 are executing and they share some resources or use some information from other process.
                 process one generates some infermation or resources are being used and it keeps it as a recored in shared memmory,
                 when process2 need to use shared memory it wll check the recored stored in shared memory and acts accordingly.
                 example:- producer consumer problem.
                 
                 
 Message Passing:-in this method processes communicate with each other without using any kind of shared memory.
